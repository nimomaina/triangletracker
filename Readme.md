## By Wairimu Maina
A student at Moringa School and an aspiring software developer.
## Description
This is a site that takes three values from a user and gives the type of triangle depending on those values.

## Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
The site compares the three values given by the user.
* It first checks whether the values can form a triangle if the sum of two sides is greater than the other side. If not it tells the user it's not a triangle.
* When the the user inputs equal values it gives an equilateral triangle.
* When only two sides are equal and the sum of two sides is greater than the remaining side, it gives an Isosceles triangle
* If none of the sides are equal and the sum of two sides is greater than the remaining side it outputs a scalene triangle.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Have knowledge of Github, HTML, JAVASCRIPT and CSS.
* You need to install a text editor like atom, Git, and Chrome
* Git clone the repository at https://github.com/nimomaina/triangletracker.git
